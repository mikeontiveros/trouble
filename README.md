### Rules

* The game is for 2-4 players - colors red, yellow, green and blue.

* Users will have the option to have the computer play for any of the colors, including an all-computer game of up to four players.

* Each player has a "home base" and a "finish lane", both with four slots for his four pieces.

* The four slots in each home base are unordered, i.e. they are equivalent.

* The four slots in each finish lane are ordered, i.e. the finish lane comprises "finish" slots numbered 1-4, which are 1-4 slots removed from the play loop, respectively.

* The play loop consists of 28 slots, including one "start" slot for each of the maximum four players, located in front of the their respective home bases.

* The objective is to move all of one's pieces first from home base to one's start slot, then around the 28-slot play loop, and finally into one's finish lane.

* Players may choose to continue playing until only one player has failed to achieve his objective.

* Turns and piece advancment around the play loop go in a clockwise direction.

* A player begins his turn by rolling a standard six-sided die, using the "pop-o-matic" at the center of the board.  The result of the roll determines the slot to which a player may advance at most one of his pieces.

* A player may advance one of his pieces from his home base to his starting slot only after rolling a six.

* Once a player advances a piece to the starting slot, he may advance it around the play loop by as many slots as the number (1-6) he rolled.

* A player may not advance a piece to any slot, be it in the play loop (including his own starting slot) or in his finish lane, if that slot is occupied by another of his pieces.

* If a player advances a piece to a slot occupied by another player's piece, the other player's piece is returned to the other player's home base.

* To move a piece from the play loop to "finish" slot number N his finish lane, a player must roll a number equal to the sum of N and the number of slots the piece must move to complete the play loop.

* A player may use his turn to advance pieces within his finish lane.

* If a player cannot make a move given what he has rolled, he forfeits that turn.

* A player gets another turn after rolling a six, even if he is unable to play the six he just rolled.
